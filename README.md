## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learned the use of Regex to validate the emails, and also how to catch errors and display them to the client for example the "First Name can't be empty" along with the color changing to red in case of an error


### Continued development

I want to develop further and get more comfortable with React and Js. Although i have a solution for the problems i solve i sometimes lack to find the best way to write the code leading to less DRY code

### Useful resources

- [Scrimba React Course](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact/react-forms-intro-co2774b5e9623a1cad018bc49) - This helped me save the form data into a React state in a very short way.
